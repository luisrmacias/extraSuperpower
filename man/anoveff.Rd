\title{Effect size calculation}
\usage{
anoveff(matrices_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrices_obj}{List of 2 matrices, named mean.mat and sd.mat. It is the output of the mean_sd_matrix function}
}
\value{
Vector of length 3. The first two elements are the effect sizes for the main effects of the first
and second factors, respectively. The third element is the interaction effect size.
}
\description{
Calculate effect sizes for two-way factorial designs from matrices of expected mean and standard deviation values
for each combination of factor levels. The output given is Cohen's f. Calculations are done as exemplified in the
G*Power 3.1 manual.
}
\examples{

# no interaction effect expected
refmean <- 1
treatgroups <- 4
timepoints <- 5
treateff <- 1.5
timeeff <- 0.85

anoveff(effects_treat_time)

# we add cell specific interaction effect keeping design and main effect coefficients
cellswithinteraction <- matrix(c(rep(2,3), 3:5), 3,2) #second level of factor A interacts with 3rd, 4th and 5th level of factor B
