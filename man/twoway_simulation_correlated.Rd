\title{Both regular and internal function.
As regular function takes input generated by the 'calculate_mean_matrix' function and iteratively simulates repeated measures two-way factorial experiments.
Data are sampled from a normal distribution.}
\usage{
twoway_simulation_correlated(group_size, matrices_obj, nsims = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_size}{Integer - sample size for each cell}

\item{matrices_obj}{List - Output generated by 'calculate_mean_matrix' that include cell mean and covariance matrices}

\item{nsims}{Integer - Number of iterations}
}
\value{
Dataframe with simulated outcome values, factor level labels and iteration number.
\subsection{Repeated measures design, suppose subjects from 4 independent treatment groups measured at 5 different timepoints.}{

refmean <- 1
treatgroups <- 4
timepoints <- 5
treateff <- 1.5
timeeff <- 0.85
rho <- 0.8

effects_treat_time <- calculate_mean_matrix(refmean = refmean, fAeffect = treateff, fBeffect = timeeff, nlfA = treatgroups,  nlfB = timepoints,

\subsection{Inspect plot to check if matrices correspond to design}{

}
\description{
As internal function runs with a single iteration inside 'graph_twoway_assumptions', which in itself is inside  'calculate_mean_matrix' to generate data for the cell mean and standard deviation plot.
