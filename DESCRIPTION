Description: We provide a function to create a matrix of mean values that can be used as input for the Superpower ANOVA_design function for independent of repeated measures two-factor designs. The input to create this matrix is a reference mean, number of levels of factor A, number of levels of factor B and expected effect magnitudes for each. Interaction can also be easily modeled.
