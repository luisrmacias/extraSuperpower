Description: The basic use of this package is with 3 sequential functions. One to generate expected cell means and standard deviations, along with correlation and covariance matrices in the case of repeated measurements. This is followed by experiment simulation i number of times. Finally, power is calculated from the simulated data. Features that may be considered in the model are interaction and measure correlation.
