\title{Both regular and internal function.
As regular function takes input generated by the 'calculate_mean_matrix' function and iteratively simulates independent measures two-way factorial experiments.
Outcome may be normally distributed or skewed.}
\usage{
twoway_simulation_independent(
  group_size,
  matrices_obj,
  distribution = "normal",
  skewness = 1,
  nsims = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{group_size}{Integer - sample size for each cell}

\item{matrices_obj}{List - Output generated by 'calculate_mean_matrix' that include cell mean and standard deviation matrices}

\item{distribution}{Character - Type of distribution to simulate. Possible values are 'normal' or 'skewed'.}

\item{skewness}{Numeric - Momentum of distribution skewness}

\item{nsims}{Integer - Number of iterations}
}
\value{
Dataframe with simulated outcome values, factor level labels and iteration number.
}
\description{
As internal function runs with a single iteration inside 'graph_twoway_assumptions', which in itself is inside  'calculate_mean_matrix' to generate data for the cell mean and standard deviation plot.
