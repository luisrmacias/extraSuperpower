#' Simulated independent and repeated measures two-way experiments over a set of sample sizes
#'
#' Wrapper for both independent and repeated measures two-way simulations. A vector of defined sample sizes is simulated under the
#' model provided.
#'
#' @param matrices_obj List - Output generated by 'calculate_mean_matrix' that include cell mean and covariance matrices
#' @param nset Vector - If default values are used for both 'balanced' and 'group_size', sample sizes to be used in simulations. If 'balanced=FALSE" and a matrix is provided to 'group_size', number to add to all elements of 'group_size'.
#' @param balanced Logical - Whether the study will be performed with the same number of subjects in all groups. Default is 'TRUE'. See 'details'.
#' @param group_size Matrix - Sample size for each group (combination of factor levels). Only to be used when 'balanced=FALSE'.
#' @param repeated_measurements Logical - Does the design have repeated measurements. Default is false.
#' @param loss Character - Type of selection of subjects in groups that have less observations than 'max(group_size)'. Possible values are 'random' and 'sequential'. Ignored if 'repeated_measurements=FALSE' or 'balanced=TRUE'. See 'details'.
#' @param distribution Character - Type of distribution to simulate. Possible values are 'normal', 'truncated' or 'skewed'.
#' @param skewness Numeric - Momentum of distribution skewness, univariate distribution simulation.
#' @param shape Numeric - Degree of skewness in the distribution. May be a single value, have a length equal to the number of levels of any one of the factors or a length equal to the product of the length of each factor. For multivariate distribution simulations.
#' @param inferior_limit Numeric - Value of the lower bound for the truncated distribution, defaults to '-Inf'. Ignored if 'distribution' is either 'normal' or 'skewed'.
#' @param superior_limit Numeric - Value of the upper bound for the truncated distribution, defaults to 'Inf'. Ignored if 'distribution' is either 'normal' or 'skewed'.
#' @param nsims Integer - Number of iterations

#'@details
#'
#' For unbalanced independent measures designs, this function generates a simulation with 'max(group_size)' for all combinations of factors and then eliminates observations
#' at random in those factor combinations that have less participants or study subjects. This is also the behavior for unbalanced repeated measures designs when 'loss="random"'.
#'
#' For unbalanced repeated measures designs in which 'loss="sequential"' the participants or subjects from the groups with less observations will be a subset of participants or
#' subjects of groups with more observations. The elimination strategy may not sound like the most efficient way to proceed, is quite fast anyhow.
#'
#' The 'n' column in the output will reflect how many observations each factor combination has. This should match the input matrix.
#'
#' @return List with of data.frames of simulated outcome values under different sample sizes. Each data.frame includes factor level labels, iteration number and sample size.
