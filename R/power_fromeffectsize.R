#' Two-way factorial ANOVA exact sample size calculation for independent samples
#'
#' This functions takes the effect sizes (Cohen's f) for two main effects and their interaction and estimates power
#' a range of sample sizes. The input for this function can be generated by anoveff.
#'
#' @param a Number of levels of the first factor
#' @param b Number of levels of the second factor
#' @param effect_sizes Vector of length 3. The first two elements are the effect sizes for the main effects of the first
#' and second factors, respectively. The third element is the interaction effect size.
#' @param n Number of experimental units in each group for which power (1-beta) will be calculated.
#' @param alpha Accepted type 1 error. Defaults to 0.05
#' @param factor_names Character vector of length 2. Names of the 2 factors to be evaluated. Default is to inherit names
#' from effect_sizes. If effect_sizes has no names and no factor_names are provided, factors will be named 'FactorA' and
#' 'FactorB'.
#'
#' @return A list that contains the number of levels for each factor, the chosen significance level and a data.frame in which the
#' first column is the group sample size and the remaining three columns are the power for the main effect of the first
#' factor, the main effect of the second factor and their interaction, respectively.
